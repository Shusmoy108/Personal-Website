  "My name is Shusmoy Chowdhury. I have completed my Bachelor of Science in Computer Science and Engineering from Bangladesh University of Enigineering and Technology Bangladesh University of Enigineering and Technology on October 2018. After my graduation I had joined as a full stack developer in startup company named 'BigGO Limited'. At present I am serving as a Faculty member of Southern University Bangladesh in Chittagong. I am always passionate about building new stuff. As a result I joined in the software industry as Software Engineer(Lead) Girmairi LLC . I am currently working here. I have worked in the software development as well as the deployment of the product. I am always keen to explore new fields of Computer Science. So I went to pursue Master's of Computer Science degree in Missouri State University . I am admitted in a fully funded master's program by the department. I am doing my research on cloud computing specifically in Load Balancing and Datacenter Selection Policy. Currently I am residing in USA. I am looking for full time software engineer positions in USA or Canada. Recently I have started working with blockchain technology and cryptocurrency. In leisure time I work in devlopment of different kind of softwares. Some of my work can be found in my Github Profile.\nApart from academic activities, I like to travel-meet different types of people and taste different types of foods. In my free times, I like to make outings with my friends and family.";
